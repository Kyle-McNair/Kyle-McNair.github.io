        <p class = "paragraphLeft">After graduating from high school, I went up to central Wisconsin and attended University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point. 
          There, I got my undergrad in Geography that emphasized GIS/Human Geography, and a minor in Sociology. 
          While there, I also swam competitively for 4 years and served as Men's team captain Sophomore through Senior Year</p>

        <p class = "paragraphLeft">However, I wanted to thrive more in the GIS industry by gaining more hands-on experiences in programming and visualizations. Thus,
          I continued my education at UW-Madison and recieved a Master's in GIS & Cartography.

        <p class = "opening">As you can already tell, maps have always been a passion of mine, and will continue to be a part of my profession wherever I go. Before going back to school to obtain my Master's, 
          I always wanted to find new ways and workflows that help deliver a project. Being at UW-Madison's program, I have been able to increase my skills and knowledge in 
          map design, web map development, big data visualization, UX/UI design, geospatial database design, and R/Python scripting. 
          Not only have I been able to get the most out of the classroom, but I have also taken the advantage of getting hands-experiences in the UW-Madison Department of Geography. 
          Doing work with the State Cartographer's Office, the Cartography Lab, and GeoDataScience Lab has helped implement project management experience, 
          allowing me to expand my involvement more than just technical workflows.</p>
        <p class = "opening">Now that I have graduated, I hope to find a career that involves me to apply and learn more skills, while also being a part of a team that is always engaging in researching new ways to solve geographic phenomena. What I value about being in this field is how it is always evolving and changing, as I want to be with a group who always wants to be one step ahead.</p>

        <p class = "opening">While I make maps during the day, I like to spend my free time helping out and coach one of Madison's local swim clubs, or being outside with friends and family.</p>
